Shutter motion blur on export. Pass `motionBlur` (`{}` for the defaults, or `{ shutterAngle, minSamples, maxSamples, gapPx }`) to `exportProject`, `exportProjectInWorker`/`exportViaWorker`, `exportProjectFile` and the MCP `export` tool. Each frame is rendered at several instants inside the open shutter and averaged in linear light on the GPU, in a floating-point texture. The sample count follows how far things travel on screen (keyframes, transitions, the camera, and the elements of a stage sequence), a frame where nothing moves renders once, and a hard cut (a clip edge without a transition, a `tl.cut`) is never blended. Sub-frame times are whole microseconds and mirror around the frame centre. Video footage uses the nearest decoded frame. The kit gains `window.__miraiclipMotion(from, to)`. Where the browser can't render to float textures the export finishes without blur and warns. The continuous-shot skill suggests blur for the final export only.
