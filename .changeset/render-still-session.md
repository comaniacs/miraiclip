Still-frame rendering: `renderProjectStill(project, { timeUs, width?, height? })` in the renderer renders one composition frame to an image through the exact export pipeline, and `createRenderSession()` in server-export keeps one warm headless Chrome across calls so a frame costs a frame, not a browser launch. Also fixes `exportProject`'s `width`/`height` output-size option, which was silently ignored (the compositor resized the canvas back to the composition size): the compositor gained `outputSize` (backends: optional `setOutputSize`), so exports and stills now honor a requested output size while composition coordinates stay unchanged.
