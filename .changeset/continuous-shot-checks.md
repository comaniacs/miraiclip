Check a sequence as one continuous shot. The stage kit now reports, for every label, whether something survives into the next beat (carried, anchored or bare), subjects that leave the frame (`data-keep-in-frame="t0,t1[,whole]"`), uneven beat spacing and stray hard cuts. `@miraiclip/server-export` exports `checkShot(doc, options)`, the MCP server gains a `check_sequence` tool, and `editorTools({ checkSequence })` in `@miraiclip/assistant` offers the same tool to a host that can run the check. `MOTION_TARGETS.shot` is a stricter target for a continuous shot, and `motionFindings` takes `{ rests }` so declared rests are not flagged. The skills now allow stillness only inside a declared `tl.rest`. Warnings never block an export.
